Music Generation or Recommendation system based on Expression or Emotion 


🎵 Emotion-Based Music Recommender
This project is an AI-powered music recommendation system that uses facial expression recognition to suggest music based on the user's current mood. It integrates with Spotify and YouTube to deliver real-time, personalized music experiences.

🔍 Key Features
🎭 Facial Expression Detection: Uses a webcam to capture and analyze the user's facial expressions.

🧠 Emotion Classification: Applies machine learning or deep learning models to classify emotions like happy, sad, angry, relaxed, etc.

🎶 Smart Music Recommendation:

Fetches mood-based songs using Spotify and YouTube APIs.

Suggests tracks that match your current emotional state.

📺 YouTube Embedded Player and 🎧 Spotify Preview Support in-app.

🕹️ Interactive UI for capturing expressions and playing songs directly.

⚙️ Technologies Used
Python (OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras for emotion recognition)

React/Streamlit for frontend

Spotify Web API and YouTube Data API

MediaPipe / Dlib / DeepFace for facial expression detection

🚀 How It Works
The user opens the app and allows webcam access.

The system captures an image and detects facial expressions.

Based on the emotion (e.g., happy, sad, angry), the app fetches related music.

Users can play songs directly within the app via embedded players.

🎯 Purpose
To blend AI + emotion recognition + music into a seamless experience that improves mood, enhances relaxation, or energizes the user—using music that truly matches their feelings.

📌 Future Enhancements
🎤 Voice emotion detection

📱 Mobile app version

🧠 Integration with generative music (AI-composed melodies)

🎨 Theme customization based on emotion
